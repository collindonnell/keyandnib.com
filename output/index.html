<h2 id="hello">Hello</h2>

<p>Hi. I’m Collin. I’ve been developing apps for iOS, macOS, and all the Apple platforms since 2008. In that time I’ve gotten to work at some really cool places on some really cool things.</p>

<p>I worked at Apple and helped rewrite Reminders and then make it even better from 2018-2021. People <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3445397/how-to-use-apple-s-new-and-much-better-reminders-app.html">seem to</a> have <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/233241/10-ways-ios-13s-reminders-app-can-turn-you-into-a-productivity-beast.html">liked what we did with it.</a></p>

<p>Before that, I worked on the <a href="https://ted.com">TED Talks app for iOS</a>, and before that I worked on the <a href="https://sonos.com">Sonos</a> apps for controlling your speakers.</p>

<p>I worked on a bunch of other things in the several years before, too. One cool thing I got to program for early on was <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things by Cultured Code</a>. So I guess I might be one of the foremost developers of todo list apps? I’ll take it.</p>

<h2 id="hire-me">Hire me</h2>

<p>Right now, I’m not looking to fully develop apps for other people, but what I <em>can</em> do is help you write your app, or help you write it better. Here’s what you can hire me to do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Code review — Show me your code and I’ll suggest ways to make it better.</li>
  <li>Coaching — Ask me things and I’ll help you. Kind of like a WWDC lab.</li>
  <li>Pair programming — Spend a couple hours working on your app together.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>

<p>If you’d like to get in touch, reach out to me by emailing <a href="mailto:collin@keyandnib.com">collin@keyandnib.com</a>.</p>

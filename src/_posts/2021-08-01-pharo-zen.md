title: Pharo Zen
---

If you're not familiar, [Pharo][pharo-link] is a version of the [Smalltalk programming language][smalltalk-link]. If you're interested in object-oriented and software design in general, you should definitely check it out.

If you go to the *Help* menu in Pharo, one of the items is Pharo Zen. I thought maybe it would be something like [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com), but it turned out to be this:

> Our values and convictions are condensed in this simple list.
>
> * Abstraction and composition are our friends.
> * Quality is an emerging property.
> * Communication is key.
> * Beauty in the code, beauty in the comments.
> * Simple processes to support progress.
> * Magic only at the right place.
> * Perfection can kill movement.
> * Examples to learn from.
> * Fully dynamic and malleable.
> * Explicit is better than implicit.
> * Simplicity is the ultimate elegance.
> * Learning from mistakes.
> * Tests are important but can be changed.
> * Polymorphism is our esperanto.
> * There is no unimportant fix.
> * Easy to understand, easy to learn from, easy to change.
> * Better a set of small polymorphic classes than a large ugly one.
> * Classes structure our vocabulary.
> * One step at a time.
> * Objects all the way down.
> * A system with robust abstractions that a single person can understand.
> * Messages are our vocabulary.

Words to live by.

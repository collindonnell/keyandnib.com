title: Use ShellCheck to Lint Your Scripts
---

Although Iâ€™ve been moving over to writing more of my scripts in Ruby, I still find that I write a fair number of shell scripts to do various things on my Mac. I don't write quite enough, however, to have internalized every best practice for writing them error free. A tool I love to use for this is [ShellCheck][link-shellcheck].

It's available in [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) and supported in [Nova](http://nova.app) (via an extension) and [BBEdit](http://barebones.com), which are the two editors I use most.

Give it a shot and enjoy less error-prone shell scripts.

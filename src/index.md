## Hello

Hi. I'm Collin. I've been developing apps for iOS, macOS, and all the Apple platforms since 2008\. In that time I've gotten to work at some really cool places on some really cool things.

I worked at Apple and helped rewrite Reminders and then make it even better from 2018-2021\. People [seem to](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3445397/how-to-use-apple-s-new-and-much-better-reminders-app.html) have [liked what we did with it.](https://www.macworld.com/article/233241/10-ways-ios-13s-reminders-app-can-turn-you-into-a-productivity-beast.html)

Before that, I worked on the [TED Talks app for iOS](https://ted.com), and before that I worked on the [Sonos](https://sonos.com) apps for controlling your speakers.

I worked on a bunch of other things in the several years before, too. One cool thing I got to program for early on was [Things by Cultured Code](https://culturedcode.com/things/). So I guess I might be one of the foremost developers of todo list apps? I'll take it.

## Hire me

Right now, I'm not looking to fully develop apps for other people, but what I _can_ do is help you write your app, or help you write it better. Here's what you can hire me to do:

*   Code review — Show me your code and I'll suggest ways to make it better.
*   Coaching — Ask me things and I'll help you. Kind of like a WWDC lab.
*   Pair programming — Spend a couple hours working on your app together.
